This project aims to predict XXX from XXXX, using dataset XXX

To run a model,

    1.make a configuration file in the 'configs' folder to select model and hyperparameters.

    2. run
        pyhton main.py "path_to_the_configuration_file"

Note that if you want to train a same kind of model but use different sets of parameters, make new configuration files each time. (This is because training result will be saved to folders that will have the same names of the configuration files.)
